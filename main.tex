%	ABSTRACT PAGE
\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are a popular battery-choice for most applications. However, future battery demand will place increasing pressure on lithium and cobalt reserves and supply lines in the medium and long term. Moreover, the electrolyte used in LIBs is flammable, which is a safety issue that has to be managed. Any mechanical damage to the cell might result in short circuits or thermal runaway reactions, sometimes leading to an explosion.\\
High abundance and easy accessibility of aluminium resources enable aluminium-ion batteries (AIBs), offer the opportunity to become an ideal alternative. Since a multivalent ion insertion is feasible, higher energy densities can be achieved. Non-aqueous AIBs use a non-flammable ionic liquid as their electrolyte, making them safer than LIBs in this regard. The most common electrolyte for AIBs is currently the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl) mixed with aluminium trichloride (\ce{AlCl3}) where a chloroaluminate ion is the active charge-carrying species.\\
This dissertation focuses on discovering new cathode materials. The author aimed to achieve an AIB with a superior performance over those previously reported. Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials showed potential as active cathode materials since they display similar properties as graphite, which is a popular choice for AIBs. Transition metal dichalcogenides, carbon-based materials, and a few others (oxides, carbides, nitrides) were tested. Results showed that some of the materials displayed high stability and long cycle life and outperformed cathodes existing in current AIB literature. A few of them were thoroughly investigated to establish the underlying mechanism. A novel cathode material was patented and is currently in the process of commercialisation!

%	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\begin{acknowledgements}
\addchaptertocentry{\acknowledgementname} 
There are no proper words to express my sincere gratitude and respect to my research advisor and supervisor Prof. Thomas Nann for his continuous support during the course of my Ph.D. and related research. For his patience, immense knowledge and endless motivation that helped me strive forward. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my Ph.D. study.
I am forever indebted to Prof. James H. Johnston who agreed to be my supervisor after Thomas shifted to Australia. He continuously guided and encouraged me to be professional and do the right thing even when the roads got tough. It is wholeheartedly appreciated that your great advice for my study proved monumental towards the success of this study. 

Besides my advisors, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Prof. X, Prof. Y, and Dr. Z, for their insightful comments and encouragement, but also for the hard questions, which incented me to widen my research from various perspectives.

I am grateful to all my collaborators with whom I have had the pleasure to work during this and other related projects: Yuta Nakayasu (Assistant professor at Tohoku University, Japan), Nonglak Meethong (Assistant Professor at Khong Kaen University, Thailand), Geoffrey Waterhouse (Associate Professor at University of Auckland, New Zealand), Sara Cavaliere (Lecturer at the University of Montpellier, France) and Ossie Amir (CEO, Carbon Valley, New Zealand).

Mr. Colin Doyle gave me invaluable help with data and statistics for X-ray photoelectron analysis (XPS) which I used in my project. I wish to show my appreciation to Mr. David Flynn, who helped me with various microscopic imaging (SEM and TEM).

I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Jayoti Chakraborty, who was a wonderful teacher and inspired me to study chemistry.

Heartfelt thanks to my fellow lab mates and friends, from past and present, Erin, Garima, Geoffry, Jake, Jacob, Moritz, Rohan and Vaibhav for the thought-provoking discussions, and for all the fun we have had in the last three years. In particular, I am grateful to Dr. Nicolo Canever, whose assistance was a milestone in the completion of this dissertation. Their presence was very important as they are the ones with whom I have shared moments of deep anxiety but also of big excitement. Special thanks to my friends from New Zealand: Abhi, Chriselle, Isabella, Kai, Leini, Parth, Ronnie, Sreelakshmi, and Tehreema for offering me advice, and supporting me throughout this entire process. \\
The final words in acknowledgment are usually reserved for those dearest to the author. I do not wish to break this tradition. A warm word for my colleague and great friend Fraser, whose words never failed to lift my spirits amid my discouragement. I would like to pay my special regards to Dr. Poulomi Roy for guiding me towards the right path, the same way she did during my Master's thesis. She taught me so much, but also went beyond that to show her love and care. 

Some special words of gratitude go to my friends who have always had my back when things would get a bit disheartening: Arti, Baibhaw, Harsh, and Saket. Thank you for always being there for me. I deeply thank Megha and Payal, my best friends for the past 20 years, who have loved, entertained, and encouraged me to get through this period in the most positive way.
I wish to acknowledge the support and great love of my family, my father, Roy Upendra, my sister, Nishika and her husband, Arindam. Thank you for teaching me that my job in life was to learn and most importantly to be happy. This thesis would not have been possible without their endless love and care.\\
The last word goes for Sangeeta, my mother, for always showing how proud she is of me for the last three years and who has given me the extra strength and motivation to get things done. This thesis is dedicated to her.
