\caption{a) Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of an Al/Mo cell using a two-electrode setup at a current rate of 40 mA g$^{-1}$. The cell failed to achieve any significant discharge capacities during both charge and discharge. b) Blank Mo foil displayed CE at 40\%. This confirmed that when acting as the current collector, molybdenum did not contribute any capacity of its own.}

The figure below presents the data that was collected using \rq pouch cells\lq\ in Fraunhofer Institute, Dresden, Germany. A pouch cell contains conductive foil-tabs, made of nickel and aluminium, which were welded to both the electrodes and sealed completely inside a glove box. The pouch cell offers a simple, flexible and lightweight solution to battery design. The pouch cell makes most efficient use of space and achieves 90â€“95\% packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs such as coin cells, Swagelok-type cells, cylindrical cells, etc.

\caption{CDCs of Al/hBN cells using pure hBN, 98\% pure, $\approx$1 $\mu$m in size using similar assembly conditions. All cells were run at a current rate of 40 mA g$^{-1}$. Despite repeated attempts, none of the cells recorded a capacity above 50 mAh g$^{-1}$. This was an issue because we were trying to replicate our previous results where an Al/hBN cells recorded capacities above 100 mAh g$^{-1}$, Figure \ref{Figures/appendix:hBNrepeat}.}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/appendix/WS2CDCCE}
\caption{ a) Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles, and b) coulombic efficiency of an Al/\ce{WS2} cell for 10 cycles at a current rate of 50 mA g$^{-1}$. A distinct plateau was seen during discharge at 0.68 V and a charging plateau was observed at 1.0 V vs \ce{Al$^{3+}$}/Al. \ce{WS2} has a layered structure similar to \ce{MoS2} with an interlayer distance of 6.18 \AA. Looking at the CDCs, a few \ce{AlCl4-} ions manage to intercalate but it seems the side reactions taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interface prevent the cell from achieving high specific capacities.}
